# Sui StreamPay

## Overview
Sui StreamPay is a streaming-based payment platform for paid content access. Readers pay based on consumption time, making costs fair and flexible, while creators receive earnings incrementally.

## Background
Subscription or upfront payment models often feel unfair for readers who only want partial access. On the other hand, creators need secure and transparent payment assurance. StreamPay closes this gap with time-metered payments.

## Built Solution
We built a system that:
- Calculates payments per time unit (e.g., every 10 seconds).
- Holds reader deposits and distributes payments to creators incrementally.
- Automatically pauses sessions when the balance runs out and allows top-ups to resume.
- Uses a Sui Move smart contract to ensure accountability and transparency.
